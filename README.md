# AutoML-Pipeline

AutoML-Pipeline is a Python project that aims to simplify the process of building and evaluating machine learning pipelines. The project provides an automated pipeline that performs data preprocessing, feature selection, algorithm selection, and model evaluation, with the flexibility to choose between classification and regression tasks.

## Features

- Automated data preprocessing including handling missing values, label encoding, and data type conversion.
- Interactive GUI for selecting and dropping columns, and choosing the target column.
- Visualization of data distribution using histograms.
- Option to choose between classification and regression tasks.
- Selection of various machine learning algorithms for the chosen task.
- Model evaluation metrics displayed through a popup window.
